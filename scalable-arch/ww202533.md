# **Learning Log: API Gateway, Docker Compose, and Local Microservices Orchestration**

**Project Context:**
We're building a simplified microservices-based system inspired by an online store backend. The services include:

- **API Gateway** â€“ central entry point for routing requests
- **User Service** â€“ handles login/registration
- **Notes Service** â€“ handles user notes (placeholder for a domain-specific microservice)

## **Phase-by-Phase Learning Summary**

### âœ… Phase 1: Single Service (Week 1)

- Implemented a basic Express.js app (e.g., Notes Service) responding with JSON.
- Learned how API routes and HTTP responses work.

### âœ… Phase 2: Add a Second Service (Week 2)

- Added User Service
- Confirmed it works standalone on a different port.

### âœ… Phase 3: Containerization (Week 3)

- Created individual `Dockerfile.dev` for each service.
- Used Docker volumes to support hot reload in development.
- Validated services run in containers on respective ports.

### âœ… Phase 4: Local Orchestration (Week 4)

- Defined `docker-compose.dev.yml` to run multiple services together.
- Each service mapped to specific ports:

  - API Gateway: `localhost:3000`
  - User Service: `localhost:4001`
  - Notes Service: `localhost:4002`

**Key Docker Compose Learnings:**

- `build.context` and `dockerfile` paths
- Mounting volumes: `- ./services/user-service:/app`
- Preventing container conflicts using `container_name` and port mappings

## **API Gateway Implementation**

### Goals:

- Handle all incoming traffic via API Gateway
- Proxy requests to correct services

### Middleware Setup

```js
app.use(
  "/users",
  createProxyMiddleware({
    target: "http://user-service:4001",
    changeOrigin: true,
  })
);
```

### Conceptual Breakdown:

- **target**: the URL the gateway should forward requests to
- **changeOrigin**: updates `Host` header to match the target
- **pathRewrite** _(if used)_: rewrites incoming path before forwarding

### Working Proxy Route

```bash
localhost:3000/users â†’ forwarded to â†’ user-service:4001/users
```

### Error Faced:

**"Error occurred while trying to proxy: localhost:3000/"**

- Caused due to mismatch between host resolution in Docker vs bare metal
- Solution: In Docker, services should talk using their container name (e.g., `user-service`) not `localhost`

## **Health Checks Comparison**

```js
app.get("/health", (req, res) => {
  res.send("OK");
});
```

vs

```js
app.get("/health", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ health: "OK" });
});
```

**Difference:**

- `.send("OK")` â€“ plain text
- `.json({ health: "OK" })` â€“ structured JSON (preferred for service monitoring tools)

## **Looking Ahead: Kubernetes & Terraform**

### Kubernetes Transition:

- Replicate same setup using Kubernetes YAML (`Deployment`, `Service`)
- Replace hardcoded ports and use `ClusterIP` for internal service discovery

### Terraform Role:

- Provision AWS resources:
  - EC2 instances for self-managed K8s or
  - EKS cluster
  - VPC, Subnets, Security Groups
- Declare infrastructure in `infra/terraform/` module

### Platform Agnosticism Strategy:

- Define resource declarations in Terraform modules
- Separate `provider` blocks (AWS, local) for different targets
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions â†’ build/push Docker image â†’ update deployment on EKS

## **Remaining Phases**

### ðŸ”œ Phase 5: Cloud Basics

- Deploy one microservice (e.g., Notes Service) to AWS EC2 manually
- Understand SSH, instance setup, and static IP assignment

### ðŸ”œ Phase 6: Infrastructure

- Setup VPC, private/public subnets
- EKS or K3s cluster setup
- Ingress controller (e.g., NGINX), TLS certs

### ðŸ”œ Phase 7: CI/CD & Automation

- Use GitHub Actions for build/test/deploy pipeline
- Add secrets management, unit tests, and health checks to pipeline

# **Final Thoughts:**

This learning plan is intentionally hands-on, focused, and gradual. We've completed the first 4 phases successfully using Docker and are ready to extend our skills to the cloud with Terraform and Kubernetes.
